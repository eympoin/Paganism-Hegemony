 GALLIA_NAME:0 "Frankish Succession Crisis"
 GALLIA_DESC:0 "Ever since the 7th century AD, the Franks who invaded Gaul have become the dominant power in the region. But ever since the last centuries, that power is declining. Lotharingia seceded from them, followed by the Kingdom itself, dividing itself between 4 duchies. Those four duchies wish only one thing: Reunite the Kingdom under their banner, but they aren't alone. The Kingdom of the Burgonds, as well as the former Roman provinces of Narbonnensis and Aquitania, all wish to take advantage of this division to gain more power. In the end, one power will come out on top as the dominant power of Gaul."
 HISPANIA_NAME:0 "Pact of Tarraco"
 HISPANIA_DESC:0 "The former provinces of roman Hispania battle for hegemony over the peninsula. For now Baetica was the most succesful in this endeavour, crushing the armies of Lusitania, Tarraconensis and Carthaginensis, forcing the latter to flee on the Baleares. That's why, these three provinces and Galicia signed the Pact of Tarraco in order counter Baetica. Tha battle for Hispania is far from over."
 BRITAIN_NAME:0 "Yet Another Invasion"
 BRITAIN_DESC:0 "And to this day, Britannia is a culturally-diverse land: The Celts in the West, vowing to kick the people who invaded their homeland, Pritani, the Norse in the North, claiming this land as Bretland, the Saxons in the Center, hoping to unify once and for all the land they called Brytenwalda, and the Romans in Londinium, who for centuries survived thanks to diplomacy and commerce, hope one day they would reconquer Britannia and enter History for the greatest achievement the Romans ever did. Four cultures, four factions are fighting for the right to rule this land. But in the end... Only one will prevail."
 ITALIA_NAME:0 "Roman Resurgence"
 ITALIA_DESC:0 "Rome almost lost everything : three quarter of the western empire seceded while the other part was overrun by barbarians. Rome is no longer at the head of the Empire but a mere kingdom trying to take back its long lost glory. The city was even threatened by the Lombards some decades ago. They were stopped at the battle of Veii but this victory was costly for Rome. Even tough it manages to take back some lost land in Tuscany, Rome is weak. It is indebted and its army is depleted. But perhaps a good ruler may be able to stabilize Rome and giving it back its old Empire, perhaps ...."
 WRE_NAME:0 "A Decentralized Empire"
 WRE_DESC:0 "The Eastern Roman Empire is not what it used to be. Where there was once a mighty Roman Empire now stands a weak decentralized confederation. The Emperor is chosen by several electors, and has a restrictive power on his empire. To make matters worse, Upper Egypt proclaimed its independence and united under a single monarch. The next few years will be decisive. Either Upper Egypt would be reined in, or the rest of Egypt will fall to them."
 PERSIA_NAME:0 "Satrapian Wars"
 PERSIA_DESC:0 "The Saffarid dynasty is declining. After almost fives centuries on the throne of Persia, the succesor of the Sasssanid are on the brink of extinction. West the Armenian Kingdom which was not a long time ago a client states grows. The Babylonian, Assyrian and Elamites revolted and these rich provinces are out of Persian control. North, the Timurid Horde threatens the northern province of the Empire. Meanwhile in the East they lost Afghanistan and Baluchistan to Zunist and Hinduist pagans. And the internal situation is no better. The satraps are tired of the failures of the Saffarid dynasty and are willing to lead one last revolt for the future of Persia."
 GERMANY_NAME:0 "European Khanate"
 GERMANY_DESC:0 "The Mongol Empire swept through Eastern Europe, and was only stopped by a coalition of Slavs, Franks and Saxons. But the heavy cost for East Francia was the death of its king on the battlefield without a heir. This triggered an invasion of Northern East Francia by Saxony, and the Kingdom was divided between several duchies. The White Horde had a similar situation, dividing itself in two: The Orda Khanate in Poland, and the Subutai Khanate in Pannonia. Nevertheless, the Mongols in Europe are far from destroyed, and if they reunify, then it might be the death sentence for Central Europe."
 SCANDINAVIA_NAME:0 "The Sami's migrations"
 SCANDINAVIA_DESC:0 "The Samis have begun their migrations southward and the Norse, too occupied by oter wars failed to stop them and lost a bunch of territories in the process. The war for Scandinavia has just begun."
 BALTIC_NAME:0 "By Thor's name"
 BALTIC_DESC:0 "The Baltic tribes are in trouble. Between the Mongol invasions and this Norse crusade, they are attacked on all fronts. Trying to survive this chaos, the Samogitians and the Lithuanians have united their tribes. Only times will tell if it is enough"
 AFRICA_NAME:0 "End of The Pax Numidia"
 AFRICA_DESC:0 "The province of Africa like so many seceded from the Western Empire when it was overrun by the barbarrians. But this province like Mauretania was soon in war against a confederation of tribes coming from the desert. This confederation was led by Kahina the queen of the Jarawa. Africa didn't survived the war but the Jarawas were merciful. Most of the cities were spared and became tributaries of the Jarawas. This Pax-Numidia benefited these cities a lot and they became prosper, so prosper that when the Jarawas were lost in a civil war, they stopped send tributes. But the civil war won't be eternal and if the Jarawas come out strong from this trial they may be able to submit the African city states again."
 RUSSIA_NAME:0 "The Three Princes"
 RUSSIA_DESC:0 "With the Mongols weakened, the Russian princes quickly took back their independance and try to put under influence the rest of the Russian World. Three princes were better than the others at this game : the princes of Kiev, Novgorod and Rostov managed to secure significant territories and influence. The tensions between them are raising and war seems inevitable. But they are not the only players in the region, the Cumans managed to secure a part of their old Empire and have interests in the Russian affairs. The Ugric tribes in the north, recently feudalized, will try to take their former territories. The war for Russia has only begun."

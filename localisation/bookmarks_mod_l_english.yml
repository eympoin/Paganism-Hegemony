 GALLIA_NAME:0 "Frankish Succession Crisis"
 GALLIA_DESC:0 "Ever since the 7th century AD, the Franks who invaded Gaul have become the dominant power in the region. But ever since the last centuries, that power is declining. Lotharingia seceded from them, followed by the Kingdom itself, dividing itself between 4 duchies. Those four duchies wish only one thing: Reunite the Kingdom under their banner, but they aren't alone. The Kingdom of the Burgonds, as well as the former Roman provinces of Narbonnensis and Aquitania, all wish to take advantage of this division to gain more power. In the end, one power will come out on top as the dominant power of Gaul."
 HISPANIA_NAME:0 "Pact of Tarraco"
 HISPANIA_DESC:0 "The former Roman provinces of Hispania battle for domination over the Iberian peninsula, with Baetica coming out on top. After a series of victories over Lusitania, Tarraconensis and Carthaginensis, the latter being forced to retreat on the Balearic Islands, they formed the Pact of Tarraco, a coalition against Baetica, but will it be enough to counter them now? The battle for Iberia is far from over, and in the end, only one will rule them all."
 BRITAIN_NAME:0 "Yet Another Invasion"
 BRITAIN_DESC:0 "And to this day, Britannia is a culturally-diverse land: The Celts in the West, vowing to kick the people who invaded their homeland, Pritani, the Norse in the North, claiming this land as Bretland, the Saxons in the Center, hoping to unify once and for all the land they called Brytenwalda, and the Romans in Londinium, who for centuries survived thanks to diplomacy and commerce, hope one day they would reconquer Britannia and enter History for the greatest achievement the Romans ever did. Four cultures, four factions are fighting for the right to rule this land. But in the end... Only one will prevail."
 ITALIA_NAME:0 "Roman Resurgence"
 ITALIA_DESC:0 "Rome, the Eternal City, and founder of the greatest empire in Europe. Once a shining city admired by many, now a decadent state that try to reclaim its former glory. The Lombards nearly conquered the city, but were vanquished at the battle of Veii, but how long will it last? The kingdom is in debt and its army depleted. It would take a strong and charismatic king to reclaim the once mightiest empire in Europe..."
 WRE_NAME:0 "A Decentralized Empire"
 WRE_DESC:0 "The Eastern Roman Empire is not what it used to be. Where there was once a mighty Roman Empire now stands a weak decentralized confederation. The Emperor is chosen by several electors, and has a restrictive power on his empire. To make matters worse, Upper Egypt proclaimed its independence and united under a single monarch. The next few years will be decisive. Either Upper Egypt would be reined in, or the rest of Egypt will fall to them."
 PERSIA_NAME:0 "Satrapian Wars"
 PERSIA_DESC:0 "After five centuries of reign after the Sassanid Dynasty, the Saffarid Dynasty is declining. Armenia, not a long time ago a client state to Persia, is now becoming a powerful threat after their expansion in the Caucasus. Assyria, Babylonia and Elymais broke away from Persia, while the Timurid Horde threatens the northern satrapies of Persia, with Afghanistan and Baluchistan also declaring independence. The internal situation was no better, as the satraps are tired of the Shahanshah and are inclined to start a revolt against him. Will Persia rise up like a phoenix from its ashes, or fall into oblivion?"
 GERMANY_NAME:0 "European Khanate"
 GERMANY_DESC:0 "The Mongol Empire swept through Eastern Europe, and was only stopped by a coalition of Slavs, Franks and Saxons. But the heavy cost for East Francia was the death of its king on the battlefield without a heir. This triggered an invasion of Northern East Francia by Saxony, and the Kingdom was divided between several duchies. The White Horde had a similar situation, dividing itself in two: The Orda Khanate in Poland, and the Subutai Khanate in Pannonia. Nevertheless, the Mongols in Europe are far from destroyed, and if they reunify, then it might be the death sentence for Central Europe."
 SCANDINAVIA_NAME:0 "The Sami's Migrations"
 SCANDINAVIA_DESC:0 "The lack of ressources in Finland caused the Sami people to migrate west, towards Scandinavia. The sparse population of the Scandinavians allowed for a quick expansion for the Sami west. Against this non-ending threat, can the Norse unite and repel the invaders? Or will the Sami unite the Scandinavian Peninsula under their rule?"
 BALTIC_NAME:0 "In the Name of Thor"
 BALTIC_DESC:0 "The Baltic Tribes are a bunch of warriors, born from blood, fire and iron. For centuries they have fought countless enemies, seeking to conquer their homeland. First by the Mongols, and now by the Norse, lead by the Jomsvikings, who conquered the coasts of the Baltic Sea. In the middle of this chaos, the tribes of Samogitia and Lithuania have united to fight these threats. Only time will tell if this is enough to push them back, or fail and be conquered."
 AFRICA_NAME:0 "End of The Pax Numidia"
 AFRICA_DESC:0 "The Roman province of Africa, like many others, seceded from the Western Roman Empire when it was overrun by barbarians. But peace wouldn't last, as Kahina, Queen of the Jarawa, united the Numidian tribes to conquer North Africa under a confederation. Luckily, the coastal cities of Africa were spared, and became tributaries, starting the Pax Numidia. It allowed both Jarawa and the tributaries wealth and prosperity, but it wasn't to last. Now a civil war broke out in the Jarawan Confederation, and this raises a question: Should the tributaries remain loyal to them, or forge a new path for themselves?"
 RUSSIA_NAME:0 "The Three Princes"
 RUSSIA_DESC:0 "With the dissolution of the Mongol Empire, the principalities of Russia declared independence and tried to assert their dominance on the others. Three principalities managed to be better than the others: The principalities of Kyiv, Novgorod and Rostov, who secured a lot of territories and influence. However, tensions are rising, and war will break out between them. But they aren't the only ones looking for hegemony of Russia. The Cumans, having their empire crushed by the Mongols a while ago, managed to regain parts of their territory, and wish to retake the rest. The Ugric tribes, having recently feudalized their societies, are looking to regain the territories the three principalities have taken from them before. With this amount of players, hell will break out, and it will actually freeze over."

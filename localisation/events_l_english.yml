flavor_ctg.2.t:0 "Carthago's Destiny"

flavor_ctg.3.t:0 "Army of the Republic"
flavor_ctg.3.d:0 "Our army so far was based on mercenary contracts with Numidians, Sicilians and Africans. Its main problem is to deliver their money, but also the language barrier, and lack of professionalism. There's a reason we lost the Punic Wars, after all. What some of our senators are proposing is to make military service mandatory, in order to have a professional army made of citizens, which will be more efficient. The downside is that it will make the maintenance costier and harder to maintain. What should be our army like?"
flavor_ctg.3.a:0 "We shall have a professional army made of citizens!"
flavor_ctg.3.b:0 "We shall renew our mercenary contracts!"

flavor_ctg.4.t:0 "Trade Focus"
flavor_ctg.4.d:0 "Ever since our former king focused on war than commerce, our trade policy was pretty much non-existent. Now that we are in power, we must think of our trade policy. Should we focus on internal trading, to increase our production? Should we focus on external trading, to attract foreign traders? Or perhaps we should take a mixed approach, and have both benefits, albeit weakened?"
flavor_ctg.4.a:0 "We shall focus on internal trade, our people first!"
flavor_ctg.4.b:0 "We shall focus on external trade, our business first!"
flavor_ctg.4.c:0 "We shall take a balanced approach!"

flavor_ctg.5.t:0 "Seats of Power"
flavor_ctg.5.d:0 "We began as a city state, a tributary to the Jarawa. But as we expand, the power of the central government of Carthago is decreasing. Some senators suggest the creation of other senates throughout the territory, so they can make decisions on minor stuff that doesn't require the full attention of Carthago. What should we do?"
flavor_ctg.5.a:0 "The Senate is in Carthago, and in Carthago only!"
flavor_ctg.5.b:0 "Carthago is united with its cities, allow the creation of senates in the other cities!"

flavor_ctg.6.t:0 "Political cleansing"
flavor_ctg.6.d:0 "The monarchy remains but the young king still has many ennemies in the nobility and the merchant class. Supporters of a republic continue their plots. What should we do ?"

flavor_ctg.7.t:0 "Letters and Science"

flavor_ctg.7.b:0 "Scientists will gives us new knowledge"
flavor_ctg.7.c:0 "Both are equally importants"

flavor_ctg.8.t:0 "Power of the clergy"
flavor_ctg.8.d:0 "With the assassination of the king and the chaos following it, the clergy took a lot of power. They asked to crown the king when he will be of age. Should we accept ?"
flavor_ctg.8.a:0 "The King is a God, no priest are allowed to crown him."
flavor_ctg.8.b:0 "Let the clergy crown him. They could be important allies"
flavor_ctg.8.c:0 "They won't crown him."

flavor_ctg.9.t:0 "The King and the others."
flavor_ctg.9.d:0 "The last monarchy showed its limit. The king should have the support of the nobility and there are two ways to do that : give them the pwoer of choosing the heir or make them fear the king."
flavor_ctg.9.a:0 "There is only one who rules."
flavor_ctg.9.b:0 "Hopefully they will support a good heir."


flavor_ctg.10.t:0 "Cultural Shift"
flavor_ctg.10.d:0 "For centuries, we have been dominated by the Roman culture. But as we expand, memories of our ancient Phoenician culture resurged, and more and more of our people wish to return to our ancient roots. But would it be worth it? Many of our Roman brothers would despise us for betraying them, but could it allow us a return to greatness, in a time we were Rome's greatest enemy?"
flavor_ctg.10.a:0 "We are still Romans no matter what!"
flavor_ctg.10.b:0 "We are Carthaginians, Rome's nemesis!"

flavor_ctg.21.t:0 "The Call of Tanit"
flavor_ctg.21.d:0 "As we reconnect with our ancient roots, we have stumbled upon ancient books, talking of our customs when we were at our highest peak. It was then we remember of our Phoenician gods, like Tanit. Now that we have cut our ties with Roman culture, it might be a good time to cut our ties with Roman religion, so we can truly call ourselves Carthaginians. However, that would be a huge destabilizing move, and our Roman neighbors would despise us even more. Should we end Roman influence once and for all?"
flavor_ctg.21.a:0 "We won't be Carthaginians without our ancient gods!"
flavor_ctg.21.b:0 "They were gone for too long, we can't risk taking such a daring move."

flavor_ctg.22.t:0 "The fate of inland Africa"
flavor_ctg.22.d:0 "We have conquered the desert land of inland Africa. Our advisors debate on whether we should keep it totally under our control and administration or create some kind of protectorate there"

flavor_ctg.28.t:0 "Carthago's unique colonization mechanic"
flavor_ctg.28.d:0 "Carthago doesn't colonize like the other nations. The first colony in the region will become a trading outpost that you will keep, all the others in the region will be given to a special protectorate.\n This protectorate will have a culture and religion fitting the region. They gives you a part of their trade like a colony, but you can also divert their trade. They are more or less colonies without the tariffs system. Once they have ten provinces, they will give more global trade power than normal colonies (0.1 instead of 0.05 and yes normal colonies gives global trade power if you didn't know)."
flavor_ctg.28.a:0 "That's good to know."

flavor_ctg.29.t:0 "Roma Delenda Est"
flavor_ctg.29.d:0 "Now that the Carthaginian empire is restored, it is time to show the world our strength. And what is better than avenging our ancestors and destroying Rome ? To invade Rome, we have two roads possible : taking the same road as Hannibal or taking the southern road in Italy."

As we are the ones who sent them, it would make sense to accept, but if we do, they will be the ones to gain the throne, and doing so will destabilize the Eastern Roman Empire.

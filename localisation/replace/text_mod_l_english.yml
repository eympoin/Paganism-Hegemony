rbeb_agmarDESCR:0 " Rbeb are the classic distance horse warriors of nothern Africa. Nothing to fancy but way more disciplined soldiers than our old peasants archers. They are true professional mounted archers who poke the ennemy, harass and retreat with chaos in a organised tactic, a good way to economise manpower but not arrows..."
amenkudan_agmarDESCR:0 "Amenkudan are the north african standard heavy cavalry. Why standard ? Because of the Jarrawan expansion and centralisation north african berbers are now united under one banner. With such money and manpower military schools opened and form the future elite of the army. And I think you know what comes next, this elite is Amenkudan. "
timset_agmarDESCR:0 "Timset means « fire » in amazigh, « agmar » horse so what’s « fire horse ». Thanks to the fall of Carthage we took a large number of high value slaves, scientists and great carthagians blacksmiths. They gave us the secret of fireweapons and muskets so we can massively produce muskets to modernise our cavalry. Here come the time to turn our eyes on the north."
dahra_lancersDESCR:0 "The great city of Dahra is home of our best merchants but is also a target of many pirates, and corsairs. To respond to this constant threat Dahra masters developpe a special cavalry based on speed and charge damage. This cavalry must quickly come on the pirate landing site and destroy the vile plunderers in one charge. The amazing efficacity of these tactics quickly transformed the Dahra lancers in a new model of cavalry everywhere is the kingdom."
analak_agmarDESCR:0 "Analak means « conquest » and it’s true that times on conquests are ahead of us. Our mighty kingdom is now to small for our army and since we captured the mighty carthagian fleet we can cross the sea. Hispania rich and fertile lands are in our range and they will fall to our fierce warriors and the Analak horsemen will be the first to land."
agallu_agmarDESCR:0 "Agallu is something that look to be so heavily armored that nothing can pierce it. And Agallu agmar are exactly that, the heaviest cavalry you can imagine. Their rôle is to stand slightly in front of the main force to take the ennemy fire and allow our troops to respond without taking damages. But becareful they are not standing troops and your rifle can take them down your spade will be useless too."
anezruf_agmarDESCR:0 "Anezruf, the desert, is central in our culture and in our way to fight. Nothing can hide you from the ennemy fire so the only way to win is to fire from a longer range. Anezruf agmar are experts in distance fighting using handcrafted long rifles that can damage ennemy cavalry at very long distance. In our main forces their place on the flanks to harass and disrupt the ennemy formation. "
amkeras_aserdasDESCR:0 "Amkeras Aserdas literaly means peasant soldier. So it’s simply the poor peasants forced to make war under their tribe leader authority who cannot afford a horse and a complete cavalryman equipment. "
kahina_infantryDESCR:0 "Jarawan warriors are fierce ones. But even among those men the Kahina infantry are a stunning force who fight to defend the legacy of the Kahina. The faith in their mission and their military expertise make them a deadly force who is hardly matched in northern Africa."
defensive_pikesDESCR:0 "The Jarawan might be deadly but his cost is tremendous too. So the Jarawan foot tactics focus around simple but effective square formation on long pikes and non-professionals soldiers. The main force rôle is to stabilise a frontline to allow the cavalry to smash and take the victory. "
tumbuktu_irregularsDESCR:0 "Tumbuku always seeked to take controll over the vast lands of the southern kingdoms but they lacked manpower. To achieve their objectives they developped tactics of embush , harassment and guerrilla warfare that suit their forces and weaknesses. Tumbuktu irregulars are perfect to wage long wars of attrition without killing every adult man in your country."
jarrawan_cohortsDESCR:0 "With Jarawa expansion the need for a permanent military force became more and more obvious. So the Jarawan King Azruf II took the decision to create the Jarawan cohorts. Standards foot units equiped with a light armour a pike, a spade and a round shield. Discipline is way better in these professional units than in our olds peasants warriors ones and our conquests way more simple. "
carthagian_slavesDESCR:0 "The glorious Carthage has fallen and most of his citizens are now slaves in our kingdom but these slaves are more than happy to serve in the military. Why ? Simply because it’s the only way to gain freedom and a salary for a slave in our harsh culture. They bring their tactics and, most importantly their weapons, which are among the best in the mediterranean world. "
hispanic_mercenariesDESCR:0 "Gold is now constantly flowing though Jarawa from the Africans gold mines to the roman world. Now that we are rich we can spare the lives of our men and hire mercenaries from the romans kingdoms of old Hispania to fight for ourselves with their devastating muskets."
timset_amkerasDESCR:0 "Timset means fire and fire is what bring power to an army in our world. Since we vastly recruited mercenaries in our troops we learned from them. Now old carthagians are well settled in our contry and their skills in weapon crafting is ours. So the mass production of Jarawan made rifles began and soon we were able to train and equip the first company of Timset amkeras. Jarawan army is now up to modern standards and can go everywhere without fear."
analak_infantryDESCR:0 "Time of analak is here, time of conquest. During the last centuries berber peoples united under the Jarawan power and built a powerful kingdom. But a kingdom isn’t enough, we need an empire ! Old Hispania will learn the hard way what analak infantry is capable of..."
anezruf_fusiliersDESCR:0 "The desert is a perfect place to use fireweapon, the lack of trees and relief make the terrain perfect to distance combats. Our most skillful shooters come from the desertics provinces of the Empire. They form the Anezruf fusiliers regiments, one of the most formidable forces of our times, able de wipe out the enemy at distance before they can even see who’s firing and where they are."
massinisa_regimentsDESCR:0 "With the recents discoveries of antics texts we begin to understand how old is our culture, how old is our traditions and how proud we have to be of what we are. Massinisa, a great antic numd king that fought the romans at their peak and lost bravely is heroic figure that we have to remember. Like the Kahina he represents the proud and strong berber people, so he deserves to give his name to the most experienced regiments of the Imperial army. They will proudly lead the army to avenge Massinisa and show to the romans what berbers can do."

Since the great roman reconquest ended in internal fights Tolosa and Gallic romans stand alone against the barbars.

western_hastatiDESCR:0 "While the western roman world is slowly uniting our economy heals too. We are now able to sustain a permanent army with well equiped weapons. There are named Hastati in honour of the great romans warriors who live in our memory. Let’s hope the new ones will accomplish the same."
tarraconese_pretoriansDESCR:0 "Tarraconese had been kept away from conlficts and devastation for long and developped a great economic situation.

The great reconquest, led by Caesar Lucinius II himself began a few years ago and since then nobody, barbars or greeks, could defeat the roman troops. Equiped with the newly rifles our troops are able to destroy the ennemy fireline without taking a single bullet. Better weapons are even deadlyier if we combine them with the tactical genius of Lucinius. Romans the time has come ! "

Now that we are the most powerful nation in the world we need troops to defend our hegemony from the infinite number of rival states and ambitious traitors.
